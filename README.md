* ### The Tennis Balls
  Helps to cushion the impact of a fall of more than 40 cm without any damage to the rest of the bot. Also doubles as a front-facing spoiler for our bot.
  - ### The motivation
  We tested it falling of the steps of our hostel and it failed miserably. One of the runs, the battery which was placed in the place of the tennis balls cushioned the fall a bit. This lead us to find things that could do the same thing. Suddenly, like eureka, tennis balls flashed 
* ### The code
  Has multiple speeds based on specific movements of the controller that allows the driver to make extremelyyyyyy accurate turns. Has fast and slow turns utilising the differential drive to its fullest capabilities
  - ### The motivation
  We wanted to utilize the extra safety net of the reduced speed of the 100 RPM motors for the most accurate pathing.
